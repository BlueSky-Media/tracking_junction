Replit makes some good points, but I think they're wrong about one key fact. Look at your own data from the new flow earlier:             
                                                                                                                                            
  6. Monthly Income: 6                                                                                                                      
  8. FirstName: 2                                                                                                                           
  9. LastName: 2                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                            
  There is no step 7 in the new veterans flow. It jumps from 6 to 8. You confirmed this yourself — "Step 7 was the old Name parameter. It
  got replaced with steps 8 and 9."

  So Replit's claim that "both versions still use sequential step numbers starting from 0" is incorrect for this specific change. The new
  veterans landing page JavaScript is firing step 8 after step 6, skipping 7.

  This means for new-flow sessions, the SCVR for step 8 (FirstName) will always show low or 0% because it's looking for step 7 — which those
   sessions never have.

  What I'd Ask Replit

  Check the actual step numbers being fired by the new veterans landing page JavaScript. The data shows steps going 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9 — step
   7 is missing. Either:

  Option A: Fix the landing page JS to number the new steps sequentially (7=FirstName, 8=LastName, 9=Email, 10=Phone). This keeps the
  step_number - 1 logic working and Replit's reasoning holds.

  Option B: If we can't change the landing page numbering, then we do need the "nearest previous step" fix in the SCVR calculation.

  Which is easier?

  Option A is probably the cleaner fix — renumber on the landing page side so steps are truly sequential. That way Replit's existing logic
  stays correct and you don't lose historical data (old step 7 = Name stays as-is, new step 7 = FirstName is just a different name at the
  same number).

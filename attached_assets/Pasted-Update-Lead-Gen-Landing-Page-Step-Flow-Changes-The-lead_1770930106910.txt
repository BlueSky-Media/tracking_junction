Update: Lead-Gen Landing Page Step Flow Changes

The lead-gen landing pages (Seniors, Veterans, First Responders) have been updated with a new conversion-optimized step flow. Please update your API documentation and any step-tracking references accordingly.

What Changed:

The combined Name step has been split into separate First Name and Last Name micro-steps, and a new Eligibility Interstitial step has been added between the quiz and PII collection.

New Step Flow — Seniors (blueskylife.net & blueskylife.io):

Steps 1-5: Quiz (Beneficiary → State → Budget → Age → Income) — unchanged
Step 6: Eligibility Interstitial (animated loader: "Evaluating your answers..." → "Determining eligibility..." → "Success!" → "Great News!" message with Continue CTA)
Step 7: First Name (progress 85%)
Step 8: Last Name (progress 88%) — heading: "Nice to meet you, {firstName}!"
Step 9: Email (progress 92%)
Step 10: Phone (progress 96%)
Step 11: Processing animation
Step 12: Thank You / Appointment
New Step Flow — Veterans & First Responders:

Steps 1-6: Quiz (Military Branch/Agency → State → Beneficiary → Budget → Age → Income) — unchanged
Step 7: Eligibility Interstitial
Step 8: First Name (progress 85%)
Step 9: Last Name (progress 88%)
Step 10: Email (progress 92%)
Step 11: Phone (progress 96%)
Step 12: Processing animation
Step 13: Thank You / Appointment
Tracking Changes:

trackQuizStep now fires these new step names: Eligibility Check, Contact First Name, Contact Last Name, Contact Email, Contact Phone
trackStepEvent actions updated: FirstName/submitted, LastName/submitted (previously just Name/submitted)
trackStepComplete now fires separate events for firstname_submitted (with contactInfo: { fn }) and lastname_submitted (with contactInfo: { fn, ln }) instead of a single name_submitted
contactFormStartTime now triggers at step 7 (Seniors) / step 8 (Veterans & First Responders) — the first PII input step
trackFormComplete fires at step 10 (Seniors) / step 11 (Veterans & First Responders) — the phone submission step
Total steps updated: Seniors = 12, Veterans & First Responders = 13

Update TrackingJunction API documentation with new tracking fields

We've added 3 new fields to every tracking event payload sent to the TrackingJunction API endpoint (POST /api/events). Please map these out in the API documentation and update any data schemas accordingly.

New fields added to all events (page_land, step_complete, form_complete):

country (string, optional)

Country code from geo-IP lookup (e.g., "US", "CA", "GB", "DE")
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format
May be empty/missing if both geo-IP services fail
Use case: Filter international traffic vs. domestic, identify non-US visitors in reports
browser_version (string)

Full browser name + version extracted from user agent
Examples: "Facebook 547.1.0", "Instagram 312.0.0", "Chrome 120.0.6099.130", "Safari 17.2", "Edge 120.0.2210.91", "Firefox 121.0", "Opera 105.0.4970.29", "Unknown"
Always present (defaults to "Unknown" if undetectable)
This is in addition to the existing browser field which still sends just the browser name (e.g., "Facebook", "Chrome")
Use case: Identify specific Facebook/Instagram in-app browser versions, debug browser-specific issues
ip_type (string, optional)

Values: "IPv4", "IPv6", or "Unknown"
Only present when ip_address is present
Detection: IPv6 if IP contains :, IPv4 if it matches x.x.x.x pattern
Use case: Analyze whether IPv6 addresses correlate with failed geo-IP lookups (unknown geo_state)
Updated geo-IP infrastructure (affects ip_address, geo_state, country fields):

Primary service: ipapi.co (5s timeout)
Fallback service: ipwho.is (5s timeout, HTTPS)
Flow: If primary fails or returns no state → 1.5 second delay → try fallback
Partial results: If neither service returns a state but one returns IP/country, those partial values are still sent (so you may see events with country but no geo_state)
No changes to existing fields — all previously documented fields (session_id, event_id, page, page_type, domain, step_number, step_name, selected_value, event_type, time_on_step, device_type, os, browser, user_agent, referrer, ip_address, external_id, geo_state, selected_state, page_url, screen_resolution, viewport, language, fbc, fbp, quiz_answers, lead_info, and all UTM/ad parameters) remain unchanged.

Please update the API documentation, any database schemas/tables, and dashboard report configurations to include these new fields.

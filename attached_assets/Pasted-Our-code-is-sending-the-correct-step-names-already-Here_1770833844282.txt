Our code is sending the correct step names already. Here's what we're actually sending vs. what the other AI's prompt says:

Our actual step names are correct:

Seniors: Beneficiary, State, Budget Affordability, Age, Monthly Income
Veterans: Military Branch, State, Beneficiary, Budget Affordability, Age, Monthly Income
First Responders: First Responder Agency, State, Beneficiary, Budget Affordability, Age, Monthly Income
Call-in (all): State, Age, Monthly Income, Budget, Purpose
The other AI's prompt has some simplified names (e.g., "Branch" instead of "Military Branch", "Budget" instead of "Budget Affordability", "Occupation" instead of "First Responder Agency", "Income" instead of "Monthly Income").

You should update that prompt to match what we're actually sending. Here are the corrected step definitions to give the other AI:

The key corrections from the other AI's prompt: "Military Branch" not "Branch", "First Responder Agency" not "Occupation", "Budget Affordability" not "Budget" (for lead-gen), and "Monthly Income" not "Income". These are the exact strings our pages send, so the TrackingJunction dashboard should expect these exact values.

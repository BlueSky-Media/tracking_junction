Prompt for the other AI:

I need you to make the following updates to the TrackingJunction app:

1. Update the API Documentation page to reflect the full event payload schema.

The /api/events endpoint accepts POST requests with JSON body. Here is the complete list of fields that are sent:

session_id (string, required) — UUID that groups all events from one visitor's journey. Use this to group events into sessions.

2. Add filterable/sortable columns to the Session Logs section.

At the top of the Session Logs section, add a column filter/selector that lets users choose which columns to display. The following columns should be available (some are already shown, add the missing ones):

Already displayed: Last Activity, Session ID, Events, Furthest Step, Status, Audience, Domain, Device, OS, Browser

Add these as toggleable columns:

IP Address
Geo State
Selected State
Funnel Type
External ID
Referrer
Page URL
Screen Resolution
Viewport
Language
UTM Source
UTM Medium
UTM Campaign
UTM Content
UTM Term
UTM ID
Placement
Media Type
Campaign Name
Campaign ID
Ad Name
Ad ID
Adset Name
Adset ID
FBCLID
FBC
FBP
The column filter should be a multi-select dropdown or checkbox list at the top of the Session Logs table, allowing users to show/hide any of these columns. Default visible columns should remain the ones currently shown. User column preferences should persist (localStorage).

3. In the expanded session detail view, make sure all fields are displayed, including the new ones: selected_state, page_url, screen_resolution, viewport, and language.
